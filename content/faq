Welcome to the FAQ.

Why does this website exist?
> As Americans, we are bombarded with Americanophobic content on a daily basis. Whether it's our government, our diet, our accent, or our collective intelligence, we Americans are treated poorly by members of the media and are looked down upon by many of our foreign friends. That's not fair, and there needed to be a resource showing how America shapes up compared to other countries.
